ENet for Android
================
This is a port (mostly repackaging) of the ENet network library for Android NDK by Julien Rebetez.

ENet has been written by Lee Salzman and the original ENet homepage is http://enet.bespin.org 

Assuming the 'ndk-build' tool is in your path, you can build the enet as a static library by simply using the 'build.sh' script.
